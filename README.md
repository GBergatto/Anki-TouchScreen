# Anki-TouchScreen
Touch screen functionality for Anki

Implements same drawing/writing mechanism as in AnkiDroid. Your writing is NOT intended to remain on the cards after review - same as in AnkiDroid.

Use the menu `View` â†’ `TouchScreen` to activate/change settings.

Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to toggle the touchscreen.

Use icons which will show up in the top right corner of the review screen to temporarily hide/clean the board.
Enjoy!

Warning: the version for Anki 2.0 has limited functionality, and may sometimes not work as expected; since the release of Anki 2.1, the old version is not supported.
